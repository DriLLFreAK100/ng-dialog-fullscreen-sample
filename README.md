# Using Angular Material Dialog During Fullscreen

This is a sample project to showcase the usage of Angular Material Dialog when the application has entered Fullscreen mode, i.e. after someElement.requestFullscreen();

Basically, it is just a demonstration from notes found in the official doc https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview, last tiny section - "Full-screen overlays"
